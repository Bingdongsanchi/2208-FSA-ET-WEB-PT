# Week 2: DOM & Events
## Other Useful Resources
### CSS:
- Flexbox Froggy: https://flexboxfroggy.com/
  - Interactive coding site that inspired the CSS Bento lab you all did a few days ago. It's very similar to that except specific to learning how to work with flexbox and concepts surrounding flexbox
- Flexbox Zombies: https://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies
  - Very similar to Flexbox Froggies but muuuuuch more in-depth and longer. If you have a lot of time and want to do a deep-dive into how to use flexbox, this is a good path to take.
### DOM/JS
- Whack-A-Mole Lab: https://fullstack.instructure.com/courses/408/pages/whack-a-mole-intro?module_item_id=111765
  - In your Engagli classrooms I opened up a new extra credit lab that'll walk you through setting up Whack-A-Mole - part 1 should be very similar to the lab we went through yesterday while part 2 is going to be very similar to the lab we're going to be doing tomorrow once it's up
- Personal Projects
  - Feel free to add some interactivity to your personal projects that you made over the weekend, trying to make weird ideas come to life and pushing the limits of your understanding is the best way to learn as a developer
  - If you're looking for inspiration, we're likely going to be making a mini cookie-clicker clone tomorrow (similar to https://cookie-clicker.co/)- that's my go-to game to make when trying to understand dom interactions

## Weekend Homework:
This week is all about manipulating the dom, so we're gonna have a bit of homework focused on using a mix of dom selection and events to interact with our sites. There's 2 main options for this - feel free to either pick one of the below options or do all of them:

- Take the site you created last weekend and add interactivity to it
Requirements:
- [ ] Add a button to your page
- [ ] Add a click listener to your button
- [ ] On click, restyle another element on your page in some way
ex: Change the color of some text on your site

- Create a mini Cookie-Clicker replica
Requirements:
- [ ] Create an empty webpage (html, css, + javascript)
- [ ] Add two items to the HTML:
- [ ] A line of text with the number "0" in it
- [ ] An image or button
- [ ] Add interactivity
- [ ] Every 2 seconds, the counter goes up by 1
- [ ] On click of the image or button, the counter on the page goes up by 1

- Do the extra credit "Whack-A-Mole" lab in engageli (Both parts 1 and 2)
